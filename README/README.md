Overview
    This is the solution of the QR Code Component Challenge of FrontEnd Mentor

My process
    I started by writing all the structure. First a <main> where I stored all the content. Then one <div> which contains the <img> of the QR Code and another <div> that contains the text.

    To style it, I started applying the general style of the page, by styling the <body>
    This was just the background color and the font

    I continued styling the page container <div>, I gave it a flex display so I could align it considering the main content. And I gave it a maximum height of the full viewport so it doesn't shrink when the viewport gets smaller.

    Then to the card container <div>, I did the most similar border radius that I could find to the example image and gave it the white background color.
    I setted the maximum width to 300px and then addded spaces in all directions with 15px of padding
    Also a shadow that just goes with a vertical offset of 10px and a blur of 50px. I used the same color of the <h1> font to make the shadow

    I gave the QR Code a width of 100% so it doesn't get out of the parent, the card container. In this way it just spreads to the size of the container.
    Also a bit smaller radius

    The description seemed to have a bigger gap than the picture, so I added a bit of padding to separate it from the borders, I also aligned the text to make it centered.

    Then I specified the color of the font in the <h1> text, as well as adjusting the size and weight of the font

    I adapted the same things for the <p> and added a bit more of padding in both left and right since it seemed a bit different in the picture
This exercise was good to catch up with things I already knew, but I got unused to them.
